                    <h2 style="color: black;">Mitochondrion – "The Powerhouse"</h2>

                    <p><strong>Position:</strong> Energy Producer</p>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> ATP Generation, Metabolism, Endurance</p>
                    <p><strong>Player Comparison:</strong> Luka Modrić – elite engine, never stops running.</p>
                    <h3>Scouting Breakdown:</h3>
                    
                       <p> <strong>Energy Production:</strong> (10/10) – Generates up to 32 ATP per glucose molecule, crucial for cellular function.</p>
                       <p>  <strong>Endurance:</strong> (9/10) – High stamina in aerobic conditions, but less effective in anaerobic environments.</p>
                       <p>  <strong>Adaptability:</strong> (8/10) – Can shift between glucose and fatty acid metabolism, but performance drops without oxygen.</p>
                       <p>  <strong>Durability:</strong> (6/10) – Susceptible to oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction over time.</p>
                       <p>   <strong>Team Impact:</strong> (10/10) – Without mitochondria, cellular performance is crippled.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scouting Notes:</h3>
                    <p>Mitochondria are indispensable for any high-functioning cell. Their ability to generate ATP makes them the core energy source, powering every cellular process. However, they require a constant supply of glucose and oxygen to perform at their best. Prolonged oxidative stress can lead to dysfunction, reducing cellular efficiency. When under attack, they may initiate apoptosis, a self-sacrifice that ensures the health of the greater system.</p>

                    <p><strong>Position:</strong> Waste Management & Recycling</p>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Breakdown of Cellular Waste, Pathogen Defense, Recycling</p>
                    <p><strong>Player Comparison:</strong> Roy Keane – relentless, aggressive, and eliminates threats without hesitation.</p>
                
                    <h3>Scouting Breakdown:</h3>
                
                    <p><strong>Breakdown Efficiency:</strong> (10/10) – Uses over 50 enzymes to break down waste, cellular debris, and pathogens effectively.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defensive Capability:</strong> (9/10) – Plays a critical role in immune defense by digesting bacteria and viruses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recycling Ability:</strong> (8/10) – Efficiently recycles useful components back into the cell but has limitations when overloaded.</p>
                    <p><strong>Durability:</strong> (7/10) – Resilient but can rupture under extreme stress, leading to cell damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Team Impact:</strong> (10/10) – Without lysosomes, waste would accumulate, leading to cellular dysfunction and eventual failure.</p>
                
                    <h3>Scouting Notes:</h3>
                    <p>Lysosomes are the enforcers of cellular cleanliness, breaking down waste and repurposing essential materials. They’re key to cellular defense, digesting foreign invaders and ensuring the cell stays clear of debris. However, they must function within limits—if too many are compromised or overloaded, they can self-destruct, leading to cell death. Despite this, their impact on cellular health is immeasurable, making them an essential part of any cell’s lineup.</p>

    <h2 style="color: black;">Golgi Apparatus – "The Playmaker"</h2>

    <p><strong>Position:</strong> Packaging & Distribution</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Protein Modification, Sorting, and Transport</p>
    <p><strong>Player Comparison:</strong> Kevin De Bruyne – elite passer, ensures everything gets to the right place at the right time.</p>

    <h3>Scouting Breakdown:</h3>

    <p><strong>Processing Efficiency:</strong> (10/10) – Modifies proteins with pinpoint accuracy, adding sugars and lipids for proper function.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution Accuracy:</strong> (9/10) – Ensures proteins and lipids reach their correct destinations with minimal errors.</p>
    <p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> (8/10) – Can adjust to varying cellular needs but may struggle under extreme protein overload.</p>
    <p><strong>Durability:</strong> (7/10) – Efficient but can become dysfunctional if overwhelmed by misfolded proteins.</p>
    <p><strong>Team Impact:</strong> (10/10) – Without the Golgi, the cell's supply chain would collapse, disrupting protein function and transport.</p>

    <h3>Scouting Notes:</h3>
    <p>The Golgi Apparatus is the ultimate facilitator, ensuring proteins and lipids are correctly modified, packaged, and shipped to their destinations. It works in tandem with the rough ER, refining and distributing cellular products like an elite distributor in a high-tempo offense. While highly efficient, an excess of misfolded proteins can cause bottlenecks, leading to cellular stress. Despite this, its role in maintaining cellular logistics makes it a crucial member of the team.</p>

                    <p><strong>Position:</strong> Detox Specialist</p>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Neutralizes Toxins, Fat Metabolism, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Control</p>
                    <p><strong>Player Comparison:</strong> N’Golo Kanté – relentless, cleans up dangerous plays, and keeps the team safe.</p>
                
                    <h3>Scouting Breakdown:</h3>
                
                    <p><strong>Detoxification:</strong> (10/10) – Uses oxidative enzymes to break down harmful substances like hydrogen peroxide and alcohol.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fatty Acid Breakdown:</strong> (9/10) – Essential for lipid metabolism, breaking down long-chain fatty acids into usable energy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defensive Capability:</strong> (8/10) – Reduces oxidative stress but can be overwhelmed by excessive ROS buildup.</p>
                    <p><strong>Durability:</strong> (7/10) – Generally stable, but enzyme deficiencies can lead to metabolic disorders.</p>
                    <p><strong>Team Impact:</strong> (9/10) – While not as central as mitochondria, peroxisomes are crucial for keeping the cell environment safe and functional.</p>
                
                    <h3>Scouting Notes:</h3>
                    <p>Peroxisomes are the unsung heroes of cellular defense, constantly working to neutralize harmful substances and keep the cell in peak condition. Their ability to break down fatty acids provides additional energy sources, complementing mitochondria. However, excessive oxidative stress can weaken them, leading to cellular damage. Despite this, they are indispensable for maintaining a clean and efficient cellular environment, ensuring long-term health and stability.</p>
